# Lab2. Implementation of Basic Quantum Computing Algorithms: Superdense Coding, Teleporation, Deutsch-Jozsa, Bernstein-Vazarani, Simon
 
In this lab, you will learn how to implement and analyze some of the most fundamental quantum algorithms using Qiskit. You will begin by understanding the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, which determines whether a function is constant or balanced with a single query—highlighting the concept of quantum parallelism. Then, you will explore the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, which efficiently reveals a hidden binary string using quantum interference. Finally, you will dive into Simon’s algorithm, an early example of an exponential speedup over classical algorithms, where you will discover a hidden string by exploiting the properties of entangled states and performing multiple measurements. Throughout the lab, you will gain practical skills in quantum circuit design, oracle construction, quantum measurement, and interpreting results from simulated quantum hardware.
